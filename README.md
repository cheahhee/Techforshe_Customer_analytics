# Techforshe_Customer_analytics
This dataset obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/santoshd3/bank-customers), contains some customers who are withdrawing their account from the bank due to various reasons. Hence, by analysing this set of data, we hope to be able to achieve certain objectives:

- Fitting the observations through a model and understand the factors that may influence the customer churn. (via supervised learning)
- Determine the target audience that are more likely to churn. (via unsupervised learning)

Through this project, we can target a specific group of people to understand their behaviour/reasons for churn. Leading to a better understanding of the customer base and possibly save cost in the long run.
