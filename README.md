# Techforshe_Customer_analytics
This dataset obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/santoshd3/bank-customers), contains some customers who are withdrawing their account from the bank due to various reasons. Hence, by analysing this set of data, we hope to be able to achieve certain objectives:

- Fitting the observations through a model and understand the factors that may influence the customer churn. (via supervised learning)
- Determine the target audience that are more likely to churn. (via unsupervised learning)

Through this project, we found that customers in the age group 51-60 and have 3 or 4 products are more likely to churn. Results seems counter intuituve since the more projects that the customers buy, the less likely the customer will leave the bank. Thus, more research on the target age group needs to be done. Additionally, the type of products being bought by the customers could bring about more insights as compared to the number of products bought. The analysis that we have done allow us to target a specific group of people to understand their behaviour/reasons for churn, leading to a better understanding of the customer base and possibly save cost in the long run.
